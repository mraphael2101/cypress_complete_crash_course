Feature: End to end Ecommerce validation

  @Regression
  Scenario: Ecommerce products delivery
    And I demonstrate passing vals after promise is resolved "valX"
#    And the fictitious table items are configured as per below
#      | FirstCol | SecondCol                         | ThirdCol |
#      | Val 1    | [{ "S": "abc" }, { "S": "def" },] | Val 3    |
#    Then I verify that the token was removed from the sample table in Dynamo Db
