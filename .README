- Cypress is npm based
- Cypress has an automatic wait capability which makes test automation easier
- Embeds Screenshots for every event (before/after) which can be traversed in the Cypress test runner
- Cypress can mock API responses out of the box (injects mock response into the browser)
- Unlike Selenium, from an architectural perspective, Cypress has no Proxy Server which interacts
  as an intermediary with the Web Browser. Instead, Cypress operates directly from inside the Web Browser
  at runtime; altering network requests/responses on the fly
- Cypress can interact with the FE and BE application
- Cypress is promoting Mocha as the testing framework of choice
- Cypress supports Chrome, Edge, Firefox and Electron (which uses Chrome for rendering and is more stable
  for automation. Electron is bundled with Cypress already). The other browsers rely on the version of the
  browser that you already have installed on your local machine
- A unique feature of Cypress is that it provides us with the capability to click on hidden elements
  on a page without having to make them visible if they are present in the DOM
- Cypress has provided a hack to work across domains using cy.origin() method which accepts two arguments which
  are the url, and anonymous function which accepts the operations that you want to perform on the new domain.
  Pre-requisite is that you must provide the url of the new domain as the first argument
- Cypress customizable commands is a concept built into the framework which allows you to create reusable functions
  in a single location which are accessible across all of your tests

To setup the Cypress project do the following:
1.) Download and install npm from nodejs.org/en/download
2.) Make sure that usr/local/bin is on your path by entering $PATH
3.) If you modify .bash_profile by appending /usr/local/bine/node then make sure that you save this globally
    source ~/.bash_profile
4.) Create a package.json file in the root directory by typing:
    npm -i init
5.) npm install cypress
6.) To open the Cypress Test Runner do the following:
    ./node_modules/.bin/cypress install (required only once)
    node_modules/.bin/cypress open
7.) Cypress Test Runner can be used to inspect the elements. Click on the target icon (to open the selector
    playground)
8.) Click on Settings -> Project Settings to add properties like where to save screenshots.
    If it is already populated then the value displayed is the default one.
    Updating the property in cypress.config.js will override the default property value.


- The Cypress Test Runner has two modes which are:
  a) End-to-end testing browser automation
  b) Component testing -> Used for integration and unit testing
  Launching either mode from the GUI adds some config code to your project
- In the JS world any test is referred to as a Spec file
  a) Create your spec file under a sub-directory of the cypress package
  b) Retrospectively update cypress.config.js with the following line in the e2e obj
     to let the Test Runner know where the specs live
     specPattern: 'cypress/integration/examples/*.js'
  c) Click save all in WebStorm. The result of this action is that the test should have been discovered
     by the Test Runner
  d) Click on the link in the TestRunner to trigger test execution
  e) You can switch between browsers by selecting the option from the drop-down in the top right
     hand corner
  f) You can run all your Cypress test cases with the run command in headless mode
     ./node_modules/.bin/cypress run
  g) If you want to run with the browser visible then you need to add the below argument
     ./node_modules/.bin/cypress run --headed
  h) If you want to run a specific test then
     npx cypress run --spec "cypress/integration/examples/test.manipulating.locators.promises.aliases.js"
  i) From WebStorm if you install the Cypress plugin then you can run the test in headless mode from
     the IDE. Note that it will run in Electron unless you override it
  j) If you want to run a specific test in chrome then
     npx cypress run --spec "cypress/integration/examples/test.manipulating.locators.promises.aliases.js" --headed --browser chrome


Mocha includes Chai
- describe -> used to define a test suite
- it -> refers to a test case

Cypress library
- cy is a global object from where you can invoke numerous commands i.e. similar to webdriver obj

Fixtures
- The directory recommended by Cypress where all your test data is put

Plugins
- This directory is used for 3rd party plugins that listen

Support
- command.js is used for code that will be reused across multiple test cases i.e. common code

Selectors
- Cypress only supports CSS and JQuery selectors Examples:
  #idname
  .classname (if there is a space between the class name then replace with a dot)
  .product:visible (a jquery selector allowing us to specify if elements are visible)
  tagname.classname (if it will help to uniquely identify the element)
  tagname[attribute=value]
  tagname1 tagname2 (equivalent to xpath tagname1/tagname2)
- instead of / give space for CSS

Cypress JS (Synchronous managed by Cypress to run Asynchronously)
- Cypress is asynchronous in nature and there is not guarantee in the sequence of execution, but
  Cypress takes care of it
- Cypress commands are asynchronous and get queued for execution at a later time. While commands are
  executed, their subjects are yielded from one command to the next. This is because a lot of helpful
  Cypress code runs between each command to ensure everything is in order.
- Cypress is internally taking care of the promise and resolving it
- In asynchronous every step returns a promise which is nothing but a state to reflect the step/code
  that was executed. States:
    -> Resolved - Step/code was executed
    -> Rejected
    -> Pending
    Ideally, you have to wait until the promise is resolved. This can be determined by using the
    .then() method, and then only it will move to the next step
- Whatever is returned from the callback function becomes the new subject and will flow into the
  following command (except for undefined).
  cy.get("button").then(($btn) => {
    const cls = $btn.attr("class")
    // ...
  })
- text() is not a cypress command so you cannot use it outside a promise.
  text() is a jquery method
- Non Cypress commands cannot resolve promises by themselves. We need to manually
  resolve them by using then()
- Cypress has the capability to handle browser events such as Window alert on open
  In the tutorial, when you click on the alert the window:alert event gets triggered
- Cypress is capable of updating the DOM to remove attribute values such as target = "_blank".
  Hence, resulting in whether or not the browser will open the content in a new tab
  or a new one. The architecture is different to selenium as it is handled in a completely
  different way
- Cypress has the ability to click on hidden elements with mouse over by using the invoke
  method and JQuery functions

Traversing through elements
- Traversing to a sibling is possible using the next() method but it only works with get()

Cypress Hooks
- The in-built capability comes from Mocha

Cypress Debugging
- Placing cy.pause() in the code will pause execution at that point in the Cypress test runner
  This will allow you to explore the state of the elements on the screen.
  You can then click Resume button in the test runner to finish off execution.

cypress/config.js
- You can retrieve the default values for the settings from the project.settings file in the test runner
- cypress.config.js is where you make the changes to control Cypress capabilities
- you can define the environment variables here
- you can specify the retries count if your application is unstable (provides more opportunities to pass the test)

npx
-  The npx command allows developers to execute any Javascript Package available on the NPM registry without even installing it

cypress cloud
- displays execution results on cloud with failure videos, logs, screenshots etc
- free access for 1-2 users. License cost implications for more than 2 people
- Displays info about failure frequency and the test execution times, and slow tests etc

CI integration for cypress and jenkins
- npm run test -- --browser chrome --parallel (Jenkins will search for multiple slaves which are available to run the tests in parallel)
- --no exit (this flag will keep the test runner open even after execution)
- --record (enables video recording)
- --reporter, -r (enables the Mocha reporter)
- --spec (provides control over which test cases to execute)
- Select option your project is parameterized in Jenkins displays Choice Parameter Section
  On a separate line add each package.json scripts: {testfmwk, run command 2} e.g. "testfmwk": "cypress run --spec cypress/integration/examples/fmwk/*.js",
- Select add build step -> Execute Shell command
  npm run "$Script"
  This will interlink Jenkins with the package.json scripts: {block} code with the associated commands under each key
  To trigger the run mode select the drop-down menu in

Cucumber integration
- 1. To install type -> npm install @badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor
- 2. Update the cypress.config.js file to register that the package/plugin were installed before running the tests
    const preprocessor = require("@badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor");
    const browserify = require("@badeball/cypress-cucumber-preprocessor/browserify");

    async function setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
    // implement node event listeners here which are loaded before every test run
    await preprocessor.addCucumberPreprocessorPlugin(on, config)
    on("file:preprocessor", browserify.default(config))
    return config // return this object just in case it is modified by the plugin
    }
- 3. Call the function from cypress.config.js by referencing it in the e2e object as follows:
     Also update the specPattern value to detect the files
  e2e: {
    setupNodeEvents,
    specPattern: 'cypress/integration/examples/BDD/*.feature'
  },
- 4. Add the below dependency to your framework
    "@cypress/browserify-preprocessor": "latest",

- 5. To enable reporting for cucumber, update the package.json with the below object
    "json": {
      "enabled": true,
      "output": "cypress/cucumberReports/results.json"
    },
- 6. In addition to step 5, download and install the cucumber-json-formatter plugin
     to convert the results into a json object format - necessary for the reporter
     https://github.com/cucumber/json-formatter
     For Mac download cucumber-json-formatter-darwin-amd64
     Rename to cucumber-json-formatter
     Paste the file in the root folder of the project in your IDE
     After running the BDD automation, results.json should be generated in cypress/cucumberReports
     Run the command which will add the dependency and update the package.json file
     npm install multiple-cucumber-html-reporter --save-dev
